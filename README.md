# FastAPI

This is a project that uses FastAPI, a modern, fast, and high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

## Features

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints². Some of the features of FastAPI are:

- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available¹⁵⁶.
- **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%². It has automatic interactive documentation, code completion, and type checks.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs². It has a simple and intuitive syntax that follows the Pythonic way of writing code.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation tested by your code definitions². It has built-in support for testing, security, validation, serialization, and more.
- **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema². It also supports OAuth2, CORS, HTTP/2, WebSocket, etc.
## Installation

To install FastAPI, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. You can use pip to install FastAPI and its dependencies. You can run the following command in your terminal²⁴⁵:

`pip install fastapi`

You will also need an ASGI server, such as Uvicorn or Hypercorn, to run your FastAPI applications. You can install Uvicorn with the following command⁵:

`pip install uvicorn[standard]`

After installing FastAPI and Uvicorn, you can create a file named `main.py` and write your first FastAPI application. Here is a simple example³⁵:

```python
# Import FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Create a FastAPI instance
app = FastAPI()

# Define a path operation decorator
@app.get("/")
# Define the path operation function
def hello_world():
    # Return the content
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

To run your application, you can use the following command in your terminal³⁵:

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can visit this URL in your browser and see the JSON response from your application. You can also visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to see the interactive documentation generated by FastAPI for your API endpoints.

## Usage
- You can structure your FastAPI application in multiple files and modules, depending on the size and complexity of your project.
- You can also use FastAPI with databases, such as SQLAlchemy or MongoDB, and integrate it with other platforms, such as GraphQL.
